LoopingCredits
==============

![Scrolling in action](https://github.com/ManjitBedi/LoopingCredits/blob/master/image1.png)


This is an example of looping credits displayed in a view controller coded in Objective-C. The credits are inserted into a scrollview in a textview.  

And now for some fun, a 3D transformation can be specify to rotate the text to make it look
credits in one of those films that took place a long time ago...

The 3D transformation code is from this project on GitHub.

The credits are loaded from a HTML 5 file and an attributed string is created and displayed in the text view.

The code is not quite working but nonetheless I think it is useful.  The app is doing some interesitng things like interrupting a UIView animation and resuming the animation based on a technical note from Apple.
