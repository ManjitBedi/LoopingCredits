LoopingCredits
==============

example of looping credits in Objective-C using a scrollview displaying a textview using attrributed text.  

The credits are loaded from a HTML 5 file.

This is adpated from a project that I worked on.

The code is not quite working but nonetheless I think it is useufl.  It doing some interesitng things like interrupting an animation
and resuming it based on a technical note from Apple.
